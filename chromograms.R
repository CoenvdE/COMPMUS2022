### Corpus motivation

I want to research soul music. I am a musician myself and make soul/jazz/funk/RnB, I am curious how the music I listen and make everyday came to be and differce from earlier Thats why I decided to see how big soul artists through the years compare to eachother. To decide what artists I should include, I made a mix of artists that inspire me, artists that have ment a lot for the genre in the persprective of my guitar teacher (jazz conservatory master) and artists that made the top on online websites (TO BE INCORPORATED LATER https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/rolling-stone-readers-pick-the-top-10-rb-soul-singers-of-all-time-16607/. These are the artists per generation:

I do think more names could be added, such as Bobby Hebbs, but I donâ€™t think this would be of use. I suspect the most difference will be seen in tempo and time, as most songs have been going faster and getting shorter through the years The tracks of all these artists will be compared, I think Bill Withers is the most atypical, because he does a lot of genres besides soul alone (like blues etc.)

This one is called "Hi", which is not a full song, but definitaly music, it is in the "This is Erykah Badu" playlist. This song has no data, valence and tempo are set to 0. Another interesting point is that 1 song of Bill Withers, Dont want you on my mind, has a very high tempo (240-250). There also was an oultier like "Hi" in the This is Mahalia playlist, but spotify took that one out during the time I was working on this assignment.

### Corpus motivation

I want to research soul music. I am a musician myself and make soul/jazz/funk/RnB, I am curious how the music I listen and make everyday came to be and differce from earlier Thats why I decided to see how big soul artists through the years compare to eachother. To decide what artists I should include, I made a mix of artists that inspire me, artists that have ment a lot for the genre in the persprective of my guitar teacher (jazz conservatory master) and artists that made the top on online websites (TO BE INCORPORATED LATER https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/rolling-stone-readers-pick-the-top-10-rb-soul-singers-of-all-time-16607/. These are the artists per generation:

I do think more names could be added, such as Bobby Hebbs, but I donâ€™t think this would be of use. I suspect the most difference will be seen in tempo and time, as most songs have been going faster and getting shorter through the years The tracks of all these artists will be compared, I think Bill Withers is the most atypical, because he does a lot of genres besides soul alone (like blues etc.)

This one is called "Hi", which is not a full song, but definitaly music, it is in the "This is Erykah Badu" playlist. This song has no data, valence and tempo are set to 0. Another interesting point is that 1 song of Bill Withers, Dont want you on my mind, has a very high tempo (240-250). There also was an oultier like "Hi" in the This is Mahalia playlist, but spotify took that one out during the time I was working on this assignment.
